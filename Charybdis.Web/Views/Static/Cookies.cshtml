    <p>We use Google Analytics software to collect information about how you use GOV.UK. We do this to help make sure the site is meeting the needs of its users and to help us make improvements. We also send cross-domain tracking information to GOV.UK to help us understand and monitor performance data across multiple public services.</p>

    <p>Google Analytics stores information about:</p>

    <ul class="usage-desc">
        <li>the pages you visit on this service </li>
        <li>how long you spend on each page</li>
        <li>how you got to the site</li>
        <li>what you click on while you’re visiting the site</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We don’t collect or store your personal information (eg your name or address) so this information can’t be used to identify who you are. </p>
